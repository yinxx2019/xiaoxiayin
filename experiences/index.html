          <h2 class="exps">Zillow Group | Public Relations Intern | Summer 2018 | Seattle</h2>
          <h3>Company Profile</h3>
          <p>Zillow Group is an online real estate database company founded in 2006. Zillow Group CEO Spencer Rascoff also called Zillow a “real estate media company” because it has “all this incredible information” and “it empowers consumers.” . Zillow’s headquarter is in downtown Seattle with over 2000 employees.</p>
          <h3>My Duties</h3>
          <h4>Daily coverage monitoring and coverage report</h4>
          <p>I monitored Zillow, ZG and competitors’ coverage and wrote a coverage report by the end of day. I filtered all coverage in the tracker. I checked if the reporters have any factually incorrect statements on Zillow and flagged coverage to appropriate team members. I uploaded the coverage report to the internal website and sent it to the executive team, communication team and ZG’s consulting firm. At the end of each month, I wrote a monthly roundup, which included highlights of the months and number counts of each category of news in the trackers.  </p>
          <h4>Media lists</h4>
          <p>I created and updated around 20 media lists by metros and beats. I used Cision for the first-round research, and I briefly went through the stories of reporters to make sure we found the right contact. </p>
          <h4>Pitching and coordinating interviews</h4>
          <p>My metros were Sacramento, Calif. and Columbus, Ohio. I usually pitched twice a week, using bullet points for factual information found by Zillow economists’ researches. I received interview requests from reporters sometimes, so I needed to coordinate between economists and reports to schedule interviews via phone or Skype, depended on the nature of the outlet. At the last week, I also got an interview request from a large Chinese TV station, so I took advantage of my language ability. </p>
          <h4>Press Release</h4>
          <p>I pulled data from a spreadsheet with housing data from 1999 to 2018 and the forecast rate when writing the news release about the “<a href="http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2018-08-09-The-U-S-Will-Gain-23-New-1-Million-Cities-Within-the-Next-Year" target="_blank">Million Dollars Cities</a>.” I used Excel to figure out which cities are forecasted to have million dollars median home prices in the next 12 months. I also pulled the list of current “  Million Dollars Cities” by Excel for comparison. I analyzed the data and “translated what the data means for homeowners, homebuyers, renters and people in certain cities. I did markets researches on two cities in a comparatively “cold” housing markets forecasted to have million dollars home prices.</p>
          <h4>Canadian real estate coverage and competitors analysis</h4>
          <p> I monitored Canadian news coverage every day and analyzed the styles, preferences and topics of all real estate, personal finance and lifestyle reporters. In addition, I evaluated the coverage pattern of all major Canadian outlets and developed pitch strategies for each. I also researched potential Zillow competitors in Canada, analyzed their coverage and gave suggestions on what Zillow should do to stand out. I’ m proud that the strategies I created worked very well and my research helped a lot when the company entered the Canadian market.</p>
          <h4>“Office Hours”</h4>
          <p>Zillow Group CEO Spencer Rascoff has his own program called “Office Hours,” in which he did interviews with famous journalists, entrepreneurs and CEOs of startups and put the interview recordings public for anyone needs inspirations. However, since he is very busy most of the time, the storytelling team is in charge of providing the background and briefing documents of each interviewee he is going to talk to. It is a fun project involves in research, finding the best angle and creative writing. I wrote three background documents for “Office Hours.”  </p>
